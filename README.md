# This project provides batch scripts to automatically set up dependencies and source code for compiling RSDK decomp projects for Windows.
# This project does not support or condone piracy of Sonic Mania, Sonic Origins, or any other software in any form. This project exists thanks to the contributions of Sega, Headcanon, Evening Star, and everyone involved in the RSDK Decompilation Project.
# This repository does not provide batch files which compile the decomps automatically it only sets up dependencies and downloads the source code
You will need to compile the Decompilations yourself by following the compilation steps from:

- https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv5-Decompilation for RSDKv5,
- https://github.com/RSDKModding/Sonic-Mania-Decompilation for Sonic Mania,
- https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation for RSDKv4,
- https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv3-Decompilation for RSDKv3.

Due to the licensing restrictions of the decompilations, I cannot provide scripts that automatically compile them, and such functionality will not be included in this repository.
# To run the scripts correctly you will need to have Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++", (Git and CMake installed or updated automatically by the scripts).
