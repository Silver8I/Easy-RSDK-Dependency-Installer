# This project provides batch scripts to automatically set up dependencies and source code for compiling RSDK decomp projects for Windows.
# Do not use this project as a means to pirate Sonic Mania or Sonic Origins
I don't condone this project as a means for piracy in any form. Without Sega, Headcanon, Evening Star and everybody working on the RSDK Decompilation Project this project would not exist 
# This Repository does not provide batch files which compile the decomps automatically it only sets up dependencies and downloads the source code
You will need to compile the Decompilations yourself by following the compilation steps from:

- https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv5-Decompilation for RSDKv5,
- https://github.com/RSDKModding/Sonic-Mania-Decompilation for Sonic Mania,
- https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation for RSDKv4,
- https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv3-Decompilation for RSDKv3.

The reason I cannot make scripts which compile everything automatically is because of the license of the decomps so i will never include such option in the repository
# To run the scripts correctly you will need to have Visual Studio with Desktop development with C++, Git and CMake installed.
